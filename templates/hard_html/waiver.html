            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A large number of students receive financial support from the university every semester. There are merit scholarships, tuition fee waivers based on academic performance, freedom fighter’s waiver, and BOT members’ and VC’s special waivers for deserving students. Tuition fee waivers range from 10% to 100% of the tuition fees depending on academic achievements.</p>
            <p>During Fall 2018, a total of 1,737 students received different categories of financial support. UAP gave an amount of Taka 3.2 crore to students as financial support in Fall 2018 – much higher than the government-mandated 6%. UAP promises to maintain similar support every semester and will increase the volume of support in future semesters.</p>
